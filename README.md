## Overview

This project, titled *"Sky Analytics: Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations,"* provides a comprehensive analysis of datasets related to flights, airlines, and airports. It aims to uncover insights into operational efficiency, delay patterns, airline performance, and airport traffic dynamics. The objective is to use these insights to recommend improvements for airline and airport operations.

## Objectives

The primary goals of the project are to:
- Analyze flight delays and patterns.
- Evaluate the performance of airlines and airports.
- Identify top airlines and busiest airports.
- Explore cancellation rates and reasons.
- Assess operational efficiency and provide strategic recommendations for improvements.

## Part 1: Excel Data Analysis

This part involves performing various data analysis tasks using Excel, such as:
- *Handling missing data*.
- *Flight delay analysis*.
- *Airport traffic volume analysis*.
- *Flight cancellation insights*.
- *Seasonal variations and flight operations trends*.
- *Correlation analysis between flight distance and delays*.
- *Airline on-time performance*.
- *Day-of-week flight operations insights*.
- *Pivot table analysis for key metrics*.

## Part 2: Excel Dashboard

An interactive dashboard is built in Excel to visualize the key metrics and insights derived from the datasets. The dashboard components include:
- *Flight operations overview*.
- *Airline performance metrics*.
- *Airport traffic visualizations*.
- *Delay cause analysis*.
- *Time-based trends in flight patterns*.
- *User interaction features* (filters, slicers, dropdowns).
- *Advanced visualizations* (e.g., maps, charts).

## Key Findings

Some potential insights from this project could include:
- Top airlines with the highest average flight delays.
- Busiest airports based on incoming/outgoing flights.
- Seasonal patterns affecting delays and cancellations.
- Correlation between flight distance and delays.
- On-time performance ranking of airlines.
- Analysis of the top airports in terms of connectivity.

## Usage of Functions and Tools

The analysis involves the following Excel functions and tools:
- *POWER QUERY EDITOR* for data merging.
- *COUNTIF, **SUMIF, **AVERAGEIF* for conditional aggregations.
- *Pivot Tables* for data summarization.
- *Scatter plots, **bar charts, and **pivot charts* for visualizations.
- *Slicers and dropdowns* for interactivity in the dashboard.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the datasets and creating a dynamic dashboard, this project provides critical insights into the aviation industry, focusing on operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and strategic improvements for airlines and airports.
